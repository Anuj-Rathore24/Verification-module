# Idea:
Generating a unified portal which can act as the collection interface for students,
organizations and companies to raise queries requesting verification of different kinds of
data and documents from the university along with submitting the required fee for each
request. This would be unified with a backend administration which can thereby receive,
approve, track, grant and notify the beneficiaries with the rightfully approved certificates.



# Scope:
Making a web portal for unifying user verification requests and the associated admin
processes through one centralized domain accessible to both ends, maintaining the
process and data flow for the administration certification with regards to verification
